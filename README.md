# Web Components

A set of Web Components for general purpose development, created with accessibility in mind

## Purpose

This is, more than anything, a place for me to experiment with Web Components and to work on accessible component patterns. My goal is to write a component for each pattern in the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).

Each component has a companion `README.md` file, explaining how to use it and what accessibility features it offers. Eventually, I'll publish them all to npm under the package name `@elihowey/web-components`.
